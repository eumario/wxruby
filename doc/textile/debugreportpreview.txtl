h1(#wxdebugreportpreview). Wx::DebugReportPreview

This class presents the debug report to the user and allows him to veto report
entirely or remove some parts of it. Although not mandatory, using this class
is strongly recommended as data included in the debug report might contain
sensitive private information and the user should be notified about it as well
as having a possibility to examine the data which had been gathered to check
whether this is effectively the case and discard the debug report if it is.

DebugReportPreview is an abstract base class, currently the only concrete
class deriving from it is 
"DebugReportPreviewStd":debugreportpreviewstd.html.
