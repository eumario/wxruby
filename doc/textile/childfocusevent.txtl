h1(#wxchildfocusevent). Wx::ChildFocusEvent

A child focus event is sent to a (parent-)window when one of its child windows gains focus,
so that the window could restore the focus back to its corresponding child
if it loses it now and regains later.

Notice that child window is the direct child of the window receiving event.
Use "find_focus":#ChildFocusEvent_findfocus to retreive the window which is actually getting focus.

To process a child focus event, use this event handler macro to direct input to a member
