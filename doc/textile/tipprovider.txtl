h1(#wxtipprovider). Wx::TipProvider

This is the class used together with "ShowTip":showtip.html function.
It must implement "get_tip":#TipProvider_gettip function and return the
current tip from it (different tip each time it is called).

You will never use this class yourself, but you need it to show startup tips
with ShowTip. Also, if you want to get the tips text from elsewhere than a
simple text file, you will want to derive a new class from TipProvider and
use it instead of the one returned by "CreateFileTipProvider":createfiletipprovider.html.

h3(#TipProvider_new). TipProvider.new

  *TipProvider.new*(%(arg-type)size_t% currentTip)

Constructor.

* _currentTip_ The starting tip index.

h3(#TipProvider_gettip). TipProvider#get_tip

 String *get_tip*()

Return the text of the current tip and pass to the next one. This function is
pure virtual, it should be implemented in the derived classes.

h3(#TipProvider_preprocesstip). TipProvider#preprocess_tip

 String *pre_process_tip*(%(arg-type)String% tip)

Returns a modified tip. This function will be called immediately after read,
and before being check whether it is a comment, an empty string or a string 
to translate. You can optionally override this in your custom user-derived class 
to optionally to modify the tip as soon as it is read. You can return any 
modification to the string. If you return EmptyString, then this tip is 
skipped, and the next one is read.

h3(#TipProvider_getcurrenttip). CurrentTipProvider#get_current_tip

 size_t *get_current_tip*()

Returns the index of the current tip (i.e. the one which would be returned by 
GetTip).

The program usually remembers the value returned by this function after calling 
"ShowTip":showtip.html. Note that it is not the same as the value which
was passed to ShowTip $+ 1$ because the user might have pressed the "Next"
button in the tip dialog.
