or deactivated.

h2. Event table macros

To process an activate event, use these event handler macros to direct input to a member
function that takes a ActivateEvent argument.



|*evt_activate()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Process a EVT_ACTIVATE event.|
|*evt_activate_app()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Process a EVT_ACTIVATE_APP event.|
|*evt_hibernate()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Process a hibernate event, supplying the member function.This event applies to App only, and only on Windows SmartPhone and PocketPC. It is generated when thesystem is low on memory; the application should free up as much memory as possible, and restorefull working state when it receives a EVT_ACTIVATE or EVT_ACTIVATE_APP event.|

h2. Remarks

A top-level window (a dialog or frame) receives an activate event when it is
being activated or deactivated. This is indicated visually by the title
bar changing colour, and a subwindow gaining the keyboard focus.

An application is activated or deactivated when one of its frames becomes activated,
or a frame becomes inactivated resulting in all application frames being inactive.

Please note that usually you should call "event.Skip()":eventskip.html in
your handlers for these events as not doing so can result in strange effects.
