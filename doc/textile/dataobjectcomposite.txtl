h1(#wxdataobjectcomposite). Wx::DataObjectComposite

DataObjectComposite is the simplest 
"DataObject":dataobject.html derivation which may be used to support
multiple formats. It contains several 
"DataObjectSimple":dataobjectsimple.html objects and supports any
format supported by at least one of them. Only one of these data objects is
_preferred_ (the first one if not explicitly changed by using the second
parameter of "Add":dataobjectcompositeadd.html) and its format determines
the preferred format of the composite data object as well.

See "DataObject":dataobject.html documentation for the reasons why you
might prefer to use DataObject directly instead of DataObjectComposite for
efficiency reasons.

preferred object if _preferred_ is true.
