h1(#wxprinterdc). Wx::PrinterDC

A printer device context is specific to Windows, and allows access to
any printer with a Windows driver. See "DC":dc.html for further information
on device contexts, and "DC#get_size":dc.html#DC_getsize for advice on
achieving the correct scaling for the page.

  *PrinterDC.new*(%(arg-type)PrintData% printData)

Pass a "PrintData":printdata.html object with information
necessary for setting up a suitable printer device context. This
is the recommended way to construct a PrinterDC.  Make sure you 
specify a reference to a "PrintData":printdata.html object,
not a pointer - you may not even get a warning if you pass a pointer
instead.

  *PrinterDC.new*(%(arg-type)String% driver,  %(arg-type)String% device,  %(arg-type)String% output, 
                %(arg-type)Boolean% interactive = true, 
                %(arg-type)Integer% orientation = PORTRAIT)

Constructor. With empty strings for the first three arguments, the default printer dialog is
displayed. _device_ indicates the type of printer and _output_
is an optional file for printing to. The _driver_ parameter is
currently unused.  Use the _Ok_ member to test whether the
constructor was successful in creating a usable device context.

This constructor is deprecated and retained only for backward compatibility.
