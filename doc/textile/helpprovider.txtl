  *destructor*()

Virtual destructor for any base class.

h3(#HelpProvider_addhelp). HelpProvider#add_help

  *add_help*(%(arg-type)WindowBase% window,  %(arg-type)String% text)

Associates the text with the given window or id. Although all help
providers have these functions to allow making "Window#set_help_text":window.html#Window_sethelptext 
work, not all of them implement the functions.

h3(#HelpProvider_get). HelpProvider#get

 "HelpProvider":helpprovider.html *get*()

Unlike some other classes, the help provider is not created on demand.
This must be explicitly done by the application.

h3(#HelpProvider_gethelp). HelpProvider#get_help

 String *get_help*(%(arg-type)WindowBase% window)

Gets the help string for this window. Its interpretation is dependent on the help provider
except that empty string always means that no help is associated with
the window.

  *add_help*(%(arg-type)Integer% id,  %(arg-type)String% text)

This version associates the given text with all windows with this id.
May be used to set the same help string for all Cancel buttons in
the application, for example.

h3(#HelpProvider_removehelp). HelpProvider#remove_help

  *remove_help*(%(arg-type)WindowBase% window)

Removes the association between the window pointer and the help text. This is
called by the Window destructor. Without this, the table of help strings will fill up
and when window pointers are reused, the wrong help string will be found.

h3(#HelpProvider_set). HelpProvider#set

 "HelpProvider":helpprovider.html *set*(%(arg-type)HelpProvider% helpProvider)

Get/set the current, application-wide help provider. Returns
the previous one.

h3(#HelpProvider_showhelp). HelpProvider#show_help

 Boolean *show_help*(%(arg-type)WindowBase% window)

Shows help for the given window. Uses "get_help":#HelpProvider_gethelp internally if
applicable.

Returns true if it was done, or false if no help was available
for this window.
