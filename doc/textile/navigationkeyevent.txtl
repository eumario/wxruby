h1(#wxnavigationkeyevent). Wx::NavigationKeyEvent

A navigation key event is triggered when the user uses the TAB key to
move forwards or backwards through the controls in a group. For example,
it may be used to track movements between multiple "buttons":button.html
contained in a "panel":panel.html, by attaching the event handler to the
panel object.
