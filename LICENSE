Distributing wxRuby2 Applications
---------------------------------

The required credits for distributing a wxRuby2 application all come from
the use of the underlying wxWidgets library. This information is summarized
below for you convenience, but is subject to change by the wxWidgets project.
Therefore, it is highly recommended that you read the official details (that
also include web links relevant documents) at:

   http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/wiki.pl?Distributing_WxWidgets_Applications


Required Credits (Copyright "gotchas")
--------------------------------------

wxWidgets seems to be licenced under a fairly permissive licence which 
makes it easy to distribute wxWidgets based applications without needing 
to apply for permission or publicise the fact that wxWidgets is being used. 

However, towards the bottom of the wxWidgets README file, there are a few 
"gotchas" which apply to binary redistribution: 

- If you use TIFF support, you need to credit Sam Leffler and Silicon 
  Graphics, Inc., in your software and documentation. 
  See the [TIFF copyright].
   
- If you use JPEG support, you need to credit the Independent JPEG Group 
  in your documentation. See the [JPEG Readme]. 
  
- If you use wxRegEx from wxWidgets 2.4.2, you may need to credit Henry 
  Spencer in your documentation, depending on what platforms your software 
  runs on, and what version of wxWidgets you are using (e.g. wxMSW will 
  use Spencer's code, but apparently most Unices will not). The license 
  in CVS HEAD for 2.5.0 is different, and a credit in the documentation 
  is no longer required. See [the regex COPYRIGHT in HEAD] 
  and [old regex COPYRIGHT].
