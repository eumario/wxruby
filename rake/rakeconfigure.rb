# rakeconfigure: sets up variables for use in compiling and linking the
# library, including platform specific options. Also determines what
# kind of build to make, and what optional wx classes are supported and
# should be built. Steps, in order:

# 1. Look at environment variables for options
# 2. Read ruby's config for info about how it was built
# 3. Load platform-specific rakefile options
# 4. Summarise main options for user
# 5. Read wxWidgets setup.h header file for supported features
# 6. Prepare the flags to be used by the compiler and linker


# FIRST: get options passed as environment on the command line:
# Force non-unicode build with WXRUBY_NO_UNICODE.

# case anyone is using it

# Exclude certian classes from being built, even if they are present
# in the configuration of wxWidgets.
$excluded_classes = ENV['WXRUBY_EXCLUDED'] ? ENV['WXRUBY_EXCLUDED'].split(",") : []

# SECOND: get a series of settings from rbconfig; these may be overridden
# in the platform-specific rakefiles below
# Get ruby's info on how it was built
