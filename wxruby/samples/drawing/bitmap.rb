# This sample demonstrates how to draw an image from a file onto a
# window. This one uses a small PNG file, but other formats such as JPEG
# are supported - see documentation for more details.
# 
# This sample uses the Wx::Bitmap class, which is a platform-specific
# representation of an image. This is the class that must be used to
# display an image, but see also Wx::Image, which allows a much wider
# range of manipulations (such as rescaling) and writing to files.

  def initialize
    super(nil, :title => 'Simple image demo')

    # Load a PNG bitmap from a file for drawing
    img_file = File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), 'wxruby-logo.png')
    @bitmap = Wx::Bitmap.new(img_file)

    # Set up the drawing to be done when the frame needs re-painting
    evt_paint :on_paint
  end

    paint do | dc |
      # Draw the bitmap at offset 10px, 10px, with no transparency
      dc.draw_bitmap(@bitmap, 10, 10, false)
    end
