h1(#wxtextctrl). Wx::TextCtrl

A text control allows text to be displayed and edited. It may be single
line or multi-line. The multi-line version can be created with the
window style @TE_RICH@ and @TE_RICH2@, in which case segments of text
can have visual styles applied to them: bold, italic, underline,
background and foreground colour, and font. Note that if the control may
need to contain longer texts - either 32k, or 64k, depending on
platform, it must be created with the @TE_RICH@ styles.

TextCtrl uses native text editing components on all platforms, and this
means there are some minor inconsistencies, particularly in the
treatment of styled text. For more complex rich text editing needs,
consider using "StyledTextCtrl":styledtextctrl.html, or for hypertext
display, "HtmlWindow":htmlwindow.html

h2. Window styles

|@TE_PROCESS_ENTER@|The control will generate the event EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_ENTER (otherwise pressing Enter keyis either processed internally by the control or used for navigation betweendialog controls).|
|@TE_PROCESS_TAB@|The control will receive EVT_CHAR events for TAB pressed - normally, TAB is used for passing to thenext control in a dialog instead. For the control created with this style,you can still use Ctrl-Enter to pass to the next control from the keyboard.|
|@TE_MULTILINE@|The text control allows multiple lines.|
|@TE_PASSWORD@|The text will be echoed as asterisks.|
|@TE_READONLY@|The text will not be user-editable.|
|@TE_RICH@|Use rich text control under Win32, thisallows to have more than 64KB of text in the control even under Win9x. Thisstyle is ignored under other platforms.|
|@TE_RICH2@|Use rich text control version 2.0 or 3.0under Win32, this style is ignored under other platforms|
|@TE_AUTO_URL@|Highlight the URLs and generate theTextUrlEvents when mouse events occur over them. This style is only supported for @TE_RICH@ Win32 and multi-line GTK2 text controls.|
|@TE_NOHIDESEL@|By default, the Windows text controldoesn't show the selection when it doesn't have focus - use this style to forceit to always show it. It doesn't do anything under other platforms.|
|@HSCROLL@|A horizontal scrollbar will be created andused, so that text won't be wrapped. No effect under GTK1.|
|@TE_LEFT@|The text in the control will be left-justified (default).|
|@TE_CENTRE@|The text in the control will be centered (currently MSW and GTK2 only).|
|@TE_RIGHT@|The text in the control will be right-justified (currently MSW and GTK2 only).|
|@TE_DONTWRAP@|Same as @HSCROLL@ style: don't wrap at all, show horizontal scrollbar instead.|
|@TE_CHARWRAP@|Wrap the lines too long to be shown entirely at any position (Univ and GTK2 only).|
|@TE_WORDWRAP@|Wrap the lines too long to be shown entirely at word boundaries (Univ and GTK2 only).|
|@TE_BESTWRAP@|Wrap the lines at word boundaries or at any other character if there are words longer than the window width (this is the default).|
|@TE_CAPITALIZE@|On PocketPC and Smartphone, causes the first letter to be capitalized.|


See also "window styles overview":windowstyles.html and "TextCtrl.new":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_new.

Note that alignment styles (@TE_LEFT@, 
@TE_CENTRE@ and @TE_RIGHT@) can be changed
dynamically after control creation on MSW and GTK. 
@TE_READONLY@, @TE_PASSWORD@ and wrapping styles
can be dynamically changed under GTK but not MSW. The other styles can be
only set during control creation.


h2. TextCtrl text format

The multiline text controls always store the text as a sequence of lines
separated by @\n@ characters, i.e. in the Unix text format even
on non-Unix platforms. This allows the user code to ignore the differences
between the platforms but at a price: the indices in the control such as those
returned by "get_insertion_point":#TextCtrl_getinsertionpoint or
"get_selection":#TextCtrl_getselection can *not* be used as
indices into the string returned by "get_value":#TextCtrl_getvalue as
they're going to be slightly off for platforms using
@\r\n@ as separator (as Windows does), for example.

Instead, if you need to obtain a substring between the two indices obtained
from the control with the help of the functions mentioned above, you should
use "get_range":#TextCtrl_getrange. And the indices themselves can
only be passed to other methods, for example
"set_insertion_point":#TextCtrl_setinsertionpoint or
"set_selection":#TextCtrl_setselection.

To summarize: never use the indices returned by (multiline) TextCtrl as
indices into the string it contains, but only as arguments to be passed back
to the other TextCtrl methods.

h2. TextCtrl styles

Multi-line text controls support the styles, i.e. provide a possibility to set
colours and font for individual characters in it (note that under Windows 
@TE_RICH@ style is required for style support). To use the styles you can
either call "set_default_style":#TextCtrl_setdefaultstyle before
inserting the text or call "set_style":#TextCtrl_setstyle later to
change the style of the text already in the control (the first solution is
much more efficient).

In either case, if the style doesn't specify some of the attributes (for
example you only want to set the text colour but without changing the font nor
the text background), the values of the default style will be used for them.
If there is no default style, the attributes of the text control itself are
used.

So the following code correctly describes what it does: the second call
to "set_default_style":#TextCtrl_setdefaultstyle doesn't change the
text foreground colour (which stays red) while the last one doesn't change the
background colour (which stays grey):

     text.set_default_style( Wx::TextAttr.new(Wx::RED) )
     text.append_text("Red text\n")
     text.set_default_style( Wx::TextAttr.new(nil, Wx::LIGHT_GREY) )
     text.append_text("Red on grey text\n")
     text.set_default_style( Wx::TextAttr.new(Wx::BLUE) )
     text.append_text("Blue on grey text\n")

h2. Constants

The values below are the possible return codes of the
"hit_test":#TextCtrl_hittest method:

     Wx::TE_HT_UNKNOWN = -2  # this means HitTest() is simply not implemented
     Wx::TE_HT_BEFORE        # either to the left or upper
     Wx::TE_HT_ON_TEXT       # directly on
     Wx::TE_HT_BELOW         # below [the last line]
     Wx::TE_HT_BEYOND        # after [the end of line]

h2. Event handling

The following commands are processed by default event handlers in
TextCtrl: @Wx::ID_CUT@, @Wx::ID_COPY@, @Wx::ID_PASTE@, @Wx::ID_UNDO@,
@Wx::ID_REDO@. The associated UI update events are also processed
automatically, when the control has the focus.

To process input from a text control, use these event handler methods to
direct the events to a block that takes a "CommandEvent":commandevent.html
argument.


|*evt_text(id)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Respond to a EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED event,generated when the text changes. Notice that this event will be sentwhen the text controls contents changes - whether this is due to user input orcomes from the program itself (for example, if SetValue() is called); see ChangeValue() fora function which does not send this event.|
|*evt_text_enter(id)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Respond to a EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_ENTER event,generated when enter is pressed in a text control (which must haveTE_PROCESS_ENTER style for this event to be generated).|
|*evt_text_maxlen(id)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|User tried to enter more textinto the control than the limit set by "set_max_length":#TextCtrl_setmaxlength.|

The following event handler works similarly for textctrls created with the
@TE_AUTO_URL@ style, but the block will instead receive a
"TextUrlEvent":TextUrlEvent.html with additional information about the
URL.

|*evt_text_url(id)&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|A mouse event occurred over an URL in the text control (MSW and GTK2 only)|

h3(#TextCtrl_new). TextCtrl.new

  *TextCtrl.new*(%(arg-type)"Window":window.html% parent,  %(arg-type)Integer% id,  %(arg-type)String% value = "", 
               %(arg-type)"Point":point.html% pos = DEFAULT_POSITION, 
               %(arg-type)"Size":size.html% size = DEFAULT_SIZE, 
               %(arg-type)Integer% style = 0, 
               %(arg-type)"Validator":validator.html% validator = DEFAULT_VALIDATOR, 
               %(arg-type)String% name = TextCtrlNameStr)

Constructor, creating and showing a text control.

h4. Parameters

* _parent_ Parent window. Should not be NULL.
* _id_ Control identifier. A value of -1 denotes a default value.
* _value_ Default text value.
* _pos_ Text control position.
* _size_ Text control size.
* _style_ Window style. See "TextCtrl":textctrl.html.
* _validator_ Window validator.
* _name_ Window name.

h4. Remarks

The horizontal scrollbar (*HSCROLL* style flag) will only be created
for multi-line text controls.
Without a horizontal scrollbar, text lines that don't fit in the control's
size will be wrapped (but no newline character is inserted). Single line
controls don't have a horizontal scrollbar, the text is automatically scrolled
so that the "insertion point":textctrlgetinsertionpoint.html is always
visible.


h4. See also

"TextCtrl#create":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_create, "Validator":validator.html

h3(#TextCtrl_appendtext). TextCtrl#append_text

  *append_text*(%(arg-type)String% text)

Appends the text to the end of the text control.

After the text is appended, the insertion point will be at the end of
the text control. If this behaviour is not desired, the programmer
should use "get_insertion_point":#TextCtrl_getinsertionpoint and
"set_insertion_point":#TextCtrl_setinsertionpoint.

Note also that this means that appending text will normally auto-scroll
a multiline TextCtrl to the end. However, the exact scrolling behaviour
may vary by platform and by the presence of styles such as
@Wx::TE_WORDWRAP@ and @Wx::TE_RICH@, as different native controls are
being used underneath. Scrolling behaviour can be controlled more
precisely by using methods such as
"get_last_position":#TextCtrl_getlastposition, 
"show_position":#TextCtrl_showposition, and
"scroll_lines":#TextCtrl_scrolllines after calling append_text. For
displaying a log of, for example, events, "ListCtrl":listctrl.html may
also be a more suitable alternative.

h4. Parameters

* _text_ Text to write to the text control.

h4. See also

"TextCtrl#write_text":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_writetext


h3(#TextCtrl_cancopy). TextCtrl#can_copy

 Boolean *can_copy*()

Returns @true@ if the selection can be copied to the clipboard.


h3(#TextCtrl_cancut). TextCtrl#can_cut

 Boolean *can_cut*()

Returns @true@ if the selection can be cut to the clipboard.


h3(#TextCtrl_canpaste). TextCtrl#can_paste

 Boolean *can_paste*()

Returns @true@ if the contents of the clipboard can be pasted into the
text control. On some platforms (Motif, GTK) this is an approximation
and returns @true@ if the control is editable, @false@ otherwise.


h3(#TextCtrl_canredo). TextCtrl#can_redo

 Boolean *can_redo*()

Returns @true@ if there is a redo facility available and the last operation
can be redone.


h3(#TextCtrl_canundo). TextCtrl#can_undo

 Boolean *can_undo*()

Returns @true@ if there is an undo facility available and the last operation
can be undone.


h3(#TextCtrl_clear). TextCtrl#clear

  *clear*()

Clears the text in the control.

Note that this function will generate a @EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED@
event.


h3(#TextCtrl_copy). TextCtrl#copy

  *copy*()

Copies the selected text to the clipboard under Motif and MS Windows.


h3(#TextCtrl_create). TextCtrl#create

 Boolean *create*(%(arg-type)"Window":window.html% parent,  %(arg-type)Integer% id,  %(arg-type)String% value = "", 
                %(arg-type)"Point":point.html% pos = DEFAULT_POSITION, 
                %(arg-type)"Size":size.html% size = DEFAULT_SIZE, 
                %(arg-type)Integer% style = 0, 
                %(arg-type)"Validator":validator.html% validator = DEFAULT_VALIDATOR, 
                %(arg-type)String% name = TextCtrlNameStr)

Creates the text control for two-step construction. Derived classes
should call or replace this function. See "TextCtrl.new":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_new for further details.


h3(#TextCtrl_cut). TextCtrl#cut

  *cut*()

Copies the selected text to the clipboard and removes the selection.


h3(#TextCtrl_discardedits). TextCtrl#discard_edits

  *discard_edits*()

Resets the internal `modified' flag as if the current edits had been saved.


h3(#TextCtrl_emulatekeypress). TextCtrl#emulate_key_press

 Boolean *emulate_key_press*(%(arg-type)"KeyEvent":keyevent.html% event)

This functions inserts into the control the character which would have been
inserted if the given key event had occurred in the text control. The
_event_ object should be the same as the one passed to @EVT_KEY_DOWN@
handler previously by Widgets.

Please note that this function doesn't currently work correctly for all keys
under any platform but MSW.

h4. Return value

@true@ if the event resulted in a change to the control, @false@
otherwise.


h3(#TextCtrl_getdefaultstyle). TextCtrl#get_default_style

 "TextAttr":textattr.html *get_default_style*()

Returns the style currently used for the new text.

h4. See also

"set_default_style":#TextCtrl_setdefaultstyle

h3(#TextCtrl_getinsertionpoint). TextCtrl#get_insertion_point

 Integer *get_insertion_point*()

Returns the insertion point. This is defined as the zero based index of the
character position to the right of the insertion point. For example, if
the insertion point is at the end of the text control, it is equal to
both "get_value()":#TextCtrl_getvalue().Length() and
"get_last_position()":#TextCtrl_getlastposition().

The following code snippet returns the character at the insertion
point or an empty string if the point is at the end of the control.

 if textctrl.get_last_position == textctrl.get_insertion_point
 	return ''
 else
	return textctrl.get_value[ textctrl.get_insertion_point, 1]
 end

h3(#TextCtrl_getlastposition). TextCtrl#get_last_position

 "TextPos":textpos.html *get_last_position*()

Returns the zero based index of the last position in the text control,
which is equal to the number of characters in the control.


h3(#TextCtrl_getlinelength). TextCtrl#get_line_length

 Integer *get_line_length*(%(arg-type)Integer% line_num)

Gets the length of the specified line, not including any trailing newline
character(s).

h4. Parameters

* _line_num_ Line number (starting from zero).

h4. Return value

The length of the line, or -1 if _line_num_ was invalid.

h3(#TextCtrl_getlinetext). TextCtrl#get_line_text

 String *get_line_text*(%(arg-type)Integer% line_num)

Returns the contents of a given line in the text control, not including
any trailing newline character(s).

h4. Parameters

* _line_num_ The line number, starting from zero.

h4. Return value

The contents of the line.

h3(#TextCtrl_getnumberoflines). TextCtrl#get_number_of_lines

 Integer *get_number_of_lines*()

Returns the number of lines in the text control buffer.

h4. Remarks

Note that even empty text controls have one line (where the insertion point
is), so GetNumberOfLines() never returns $0$.

For GTK using GTK+ 1.2.x and earlier, the number of lines in a multi-line
text control is calculated by actually counting newline characters in the
buffer, i.e. this function returns the number of logical lines and doesn't
depend on whether any of them are wrapped. For all the other platforms, the
number of physical lines in the control is returned.

Also note that you may wish to avoid using functions that work with line
numbers if you are working with controls that contain large amounts of text as
this function has $O(N)$ complexity for $N$ being the number of lines.


h3(#TextCtrl_getrange). TextCtrl#get_range

 String *get_range*(%(arg-type)Integer% from,  %(arg-type)Integer% to)

Returns the string containing the text starting in the positions _from_ and
up to _to_ in the control. The positions must have been returned by another
TextCtrl method.

Please note that the positions in a multiline TextCtrl do *not*
correspond to the indices in the string returned by
"get_value":#TextCtrl_getvalue because of the different new line
representations (@CR@ or @CR LF@) and so this method should be used to
obtain the correct results instead of extracting parts of the entire value. It
may also be more efficient, especially if the control contains a lot of data.


h3(#TextCtrl_getselection). TextCtrl#get_selection

  [ Integer *from*, Integer *to* ] = *get_selection*()

Gets the current selection span and returns the start (@from@) and end
(@to@) points as a two-element array. These two values are integer
offsets within the TextCtrl's text. If the returned values are equal,
there was no selection.

Note that on some platforms, if the selection was made by click-dragging
from right to left, @from@ may be larger than @to@. In other words, you
should not assume that @from@ is earlier in the sequence of characters
in the TextCtrl. Using ruby's @sort@ method should correct this. 

Please note that the indices returned may be used with the other
Textctrl methods but don't necessarily represent the correct indices
into the string returned by "get_value()":#TextCtrl_getvalue for
all multiline controls under Windows (at least,) 

This problem appears to be avoided if the TextCtrl is created with the
@Wx::TE_RICH2@ style, or you can use
"get_string_selection":#TextCtrl_getstringselection to get a string
containing the selected text.

h3(#TextCtrl_getstringselection). TextCtrl#get_string_selection

 String *get_string_selection*()

Gets the text currently selected in the control. If there is no selection, the
returned string is empty.


h3(#TextCtrl_getstyle). TextCtrl#get_style

 Boolean *get_style*(%(arg-type)Integer% position,  %(arg-type)"TextAttr":textattr.html% style)

Returns the style at this position in the text control. Not all platforms
support this function.

h4. Return value

@true@ on success, @false@ if an error occurred - it may also mean that
the styles are not supported under this platform.

h4. See also

"TextCtrl#set_style":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_setstyle, "TextAttr":textattr.html


h3(#TextCtrl_getvalue). TextCtrl#get_value

 String *get_value*()

Gets the contents of the control. Notice that for a multiline text control,
the lines will be separated by (Unix-style) $$n characters, even
under Windows where they are separated by a $$r$$n
sequence in the native control.


h3(#TextCtrl_hittest). TextCtrl#hit_test

 [ Integer result, Integer col, Integer row ] = *hit_test*(%(arg-type)"Point":point.html% pt)

This function finds the character at the specified position expressed in
pixels. If the return code is not @TE_HT_UNKNOWN@ the row and column
of the character closest to this position are returned in the col and
row arguments.

Please note that this function is currently only implemented in Univ,
MSW and GTK2 ports. It functionality can be faked on OS X.

h4. See also

"position_to_xy":#TextCtrl_positiontoxy, "XYToPosition":textctrlxytoposition.html


h3(#TextCtrl_iseditable). TextCtrl#is_editable

 Boolean *is_editable*()

Returns @true@ if the controls contents may be edited by user (note that it
always can be changed by the program), i.e. if the control hasn't been put in
read-only mode by a previous call to
"set_editable":#TextCtrl_seteditable.


h3(#TextCtrl_isempty). TextCtrl#is_empty

 Boolean *is_empty*()

Returns  if the control is currently empty. This is the same as 
@GetValue().empty()@ but can be much more efficient for the multiline
controls containing big amounts of text.

2.7.1


h3(#TextCtrl_ismodified). TextCtrl#is_modified

 Boolean *is_modified*()

Returns @true@ if the text has been modified by user. Note that calling
"set_value":#TextCtrl_setvalue doesn't make the control modified.

h4. See also

"mark_dirty":#TextCtrl_markdirty


h3(#TextCtrl_ismultiline). TextCtrl#is_multi_line

 Boolean *is_multi_line*()

Returns @true@ if this is a multi line edit control and @false@
otherwise.

h4. See also

"is_single_line":#TextCtrl_issingleline


h3(#TextCtrl_issingleline). TextCtrl#is_single_line

 Boolean *is_single_line*()

Returns @true@ if this is a single line edit control and @false@
otherwise.

h4. See also

"is_multi_line":#TextCtrl_ismultiline


h3(#TextCtrl_loadfile). TextCtrl#load_file

 Boolean *load_file*(%(arg-type)String% filename,  %(arg-type)Integer% fileType = TEXT_TYPE_ANY)

Loads and displays the named file, if it exists.

h4. Parameters

* _filename_ The filename of the file to load.
* _fileType_ The type of file to load. This is currently ignored in TextCtrl.

h4. Return value

@true@ if successful, @false@ otherwise.



h3(#TextCtrl_markdirty). TextCtrl#mark_dirty

  *mark_dirty*()

Mark text as modified (dirty).

h4. See also

"is_modified":#TextCtrl_ismodified


h3(#TextCtrl_ondropfiles). TextCtrl#on_drop_files

  *on_drop_files*(%(arg-type)"DropFilesEvent":dropfilesevent.html% event)

This event handler function implements default drag and drop behaviour, which
is to load the first dropped file into the control.

h4. Parameters

* _event_ The drop files event.

h4. Remarks

This is not implemented on non-Windows platforms.

h4. See also

"DropFilesEvent":dropfilesevent.html


h3(#TextCtrl_paste). TextCtrl#paste

  *paste*()

Pastes text from the clipboard to the text item.


h3(#TextCtrl_positiontoxy). TextCtrl#position_to_xy

 [ Integer *x*, Integer *y* ] = *position_to_xy*(pos)

Converts given position to a zero-based column, line number pair. If the
position requested is less than 0 or greater than the length of the
TextCtrl, the single value @nil@ will be returned.

h4. Parameters

* _pos_ Position.

h4. See also

"TextCtrl#xy_to_position":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_xytoposition

h3(#TextCtrl_redo). TextCtrl#redo

  *redo*()

If there is a redo facility and the last operation can be redone, redoes the last operation. Does nothing
if there is no redo facility.


h3(#TextCtrl_remove). TextCtrl#remove

  *remove*(%(arg-type)Integer% from,  %(arg-type)Integer% to)

Removes the text starting at the first given position up to (but not including)
the character at the last position.

h4. Parameters

* _from_ The first position.
* _to_ The last position.


h3(#TextCtrl_replace). TextCtrl#replace

  *replace*(%(arg-type)Integer% from,  %(arg-type)Integer% to,  %(arg-type)String% value)

Replaces the text starting at the first position up to (but not including)
the character at the last position with the given text.

h4. Parameters

* _from_ The first position.
* _to_ The last position.
* _value_ The value to replace the existing text with.


h3(#TextCtrl_savefile). TextCtrl#save_file

 Boolean *save_file*(%(arg-type)String% filename,  %(arg-type)Integer% fileType = TEXT_TYPE_ANY)

Saves the contents of the control in a text file.

h4. Parameters

* _filename_ The name of the file in which to save the text.
* _fileType_ The type of file to save. This is currently ignored in TextCtrl.

h4. Return value

@true@ if the operation was successful, @false@ otherwise.


h3(#TextCtrl_setdefaultstyle). TextCtrl#set_default_style

 Boolean *set_default_style*(%(arg-type)"TextAttr":textattr.html% style)

Changes the default style to use for the new text which is going to be added
to the control using "write_text":#TextCtrl_writetext or "append_text":#TextCtrl_appendtext.

If either of the font, foreground, or background colour is not set in _style_, the values of the previous default style are used for them. If
the previous default style didn't set them neither, the global font or colours
of the text control itself are used as fall back.

However if the _style_ parameter is the default TextAttr, then the
default style is just reset (instead of being combined with the new style which
wouldn't change it at all).

h4. Parameters

* _style_ The style for the new text.

h4. Return value

@true@ on success, @false@ if an error occurred - may also mean that
the styles are not supported under this platform.

h4. See also

"get_default_style":#TextCtrl_getdefaultstyle


h3(#TextCtrl_seteditable). TextCtrl#set_editable

  *set_editable*(%(arg-type)Boolean% editable)

Makes the text item editable or read-only, overriding the *TE_READONLY* flag.

h4. Parameters

* _editable_ If @true@, the control is editable. If @false@, the control is read-only.

h4. See also

"is_editable":#TextCtrl_iseditable


h3(#TextCtrl_setinsertionpoint). TextCtrl#set_insertion_point

  *set_insertion_point*(%(arg-type)Integer% pos)

Sets the insertion point at the given position.

h4. Parameters

* _pos_ Position to set.


h3(#TextCtrl_setinsertionpointend). TextCtrl#set_insertion_point_end

  *set_insertion_point_end*()

Sets the insertion point at the end of the text control.

h3(#TextCtrl_setmaxlength). TextCtrl#set_max_length

  *set_max_length*(%(arg-type)Integer% length)

This function sets the maximum number of characters the user can enter into the
control. In other words, it limits the text value length to _length_.

If _length_ is 0, the previously set max length limit, if any, is discarded
and the user may enter as much text as the underlying native text control
widget supports (typically at least 32Kb).

If the user tries to enter more characters into the text control when it
already is filled up to the maximal length, a
@EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_MAXLEN@ event is sent to notify the program about it
(giving it the possibility to show an explanatory message, for example) and the
extra input is discarded.

Note that under GTK+, this function may only be used with single line text controls.

h4. Compatibility

Only implemented in MSW/GTK starting with Widgets 2.3.2.


h3(#TextCtrl_setmodified). TextCtrl#set_modified

  *set_modified*(%(arg-type)Boolean% modified)

Marks the control as being modified by the user or not.

h4. See also

"mark_dirty":#TextCtrl_markdirty, "discard_edits":#TextCtrl_discardedits


h3(#TextCtrl_setselection). TextCtrl#set_selection

  *set_selection*(%(arg-type)Integer% from,  %(arg-type)Integer% to)

Selects the text starting at the first position up to (but not including) the
character at the last position. If both parameters are equal to -1 all text
in the control is selected.

Note that on Windows, by default, if the TextCtrl does not have focus
the selection is not shown as highlighted. Therefore the results of
calling this method may not be immediately visible. If you wish the
selection always to be shown, create the TextCtrl with the style
@Wx::TE_NOHIDESEL@.

h4. Parameters

* _from_ The first position.
* _to_ The last position.


h3(#TextCtrl_setstyle). TextCtrl#set_style

 Boolean *set_style*(%(arg-type)Integer% start,  %(arg-type)Integer% end, 
                   %(arg-type)"TextAttr":textattr.html% style)

Changes the style of the given range. If any attribute within _style_ is
not set, the corresponding attribute from "get_default_style()":#TextCtrl_getdefaultstyle is used.

h4. Parameters

* _start_ The start of the range to change.
* _end_ The end of the range to change.
* _style_ The new style for the range.

h4. Return value

@true@ on success, @false@ if an error occurred - it may also mean that
the styles are not supported under this platform.

h4. See also

"TextCtrl#get_style":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_getstyle, "TextAttr":textattr.html

h3(#TextCtrl_setvalue). TextCtrl#set_value

  *set_value*(%(arg-type)String% value)

Sets the text value and marks the control as not-modified (which means that
"is_modified":#TextCtrl_ismodified would return @false@ immediately
after the call to set_value).

Note that this function will generate a @EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED@
event.

This function is deprecated and should not be used in new code. Please use the
"change_value":#TextCtrl_changevalue function instead.

h4. Parameters

* _value_ The new value to set. It may contain newline characters if the text control is multi-line.


h3(#TextCtrl_changevalue). TextCtrl#change_value

  *change_value*(%(arg-type)String% value)

Sets the text value and marks the control as not-modified (which means that
"is_modified":#TextCtrl_ismodified would return @false@ immediately
after the call to SetValue).

Note that this function will not generate the @EVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED@ 
event.
This is the only difference with "set_value":#TextCtrl_setvalue.
See "this topic":progevent.html for more information.

2.7.1

h4. Parameters

* _value_ The new value to set. It may contain newline characters if the text control is multi-line.

h3(#TextCtrl_showposition). TextCtrl#show_position

  *show_position*(%(arg-type)Integer% pos)

Makes the line containing the given position visible.

h4. Parameters

* _pos_ The position that should be visible.


h3(#TextCtrl_undo). TextCtrl#undo

  *undo*()

If there is an undo facility and the last operation can be undone,
undoes the last operation. Does nothing if there is no undo facility.


h3(#TextCtrl_writetext). TextCtrl#write_text

  *write_text*(%(arg-type)String% text)

Writes the text into the text control at the current insertion position.

h4. Parameters

* _text_ Text to write to the text control.

h4. Remarks

Newlines in the text string
are the only control characters allowed, and they will cause appropriate
line breaks.  See "TextCtrl::":textctrlinsert.html and "TextCtrl#append_text":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_appendtext for more convenient ways of writing to the window.

After the write operation, the insertion point will be at the end of the inserted text, so subsequent write operations will be appended. To append text after the user may have interacted with the control, call "TextCtrl#set_insertion_point_end":textctrl.html#TextCtrl_setinsertionpointend before writing.


h3(#TextCtrl_xytoposition). TextCtrl#xy_to_position

 Integer *xy_to_position*(%(arg-type)Integer% x,  %(arg-type)Integer% y)

Converts the given zero based column and line number to a position.

h4. Parameters

* _x_ The column number.
* _y_ The line number.

h4. Return value

The position value, or -1 if @x@ or @y@ was invalid.


h3(#TextCtrl_insert). TextCtrl#<<

 "TextCtrl":textctrl.html << %(arg-type)String% str

 "TextCtrl":textctrl.html << %(arg-type)Integer% int

 "TextCtrl":textctrl.html << %(arg-type)Float% float

Operator for appending to a text control, for example:
 
 textctrl = Wx::TextCtrl.new(parent, -1, '')
 textctrl << "Welcome to text control number " << 1 << ".\n"
