README for wxruby2
Version 0.0.25

This is wxruby2, the second generation of wxRuby, a library 
that allows Ruby programs to use the wxWidgets GUI toolkit. 
It is released under a permissive MIT-style license
(see the LICENSE file for details).

There are no binaries yet. You must build it from source.
It now supports about 120 classes, out of the 300+ 
that are in wxWidgets.

For more details, see the project home page:
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/wxruby/


WHATS NEW:

- Added src/.cvsignore
- Added Button constants (BU_XXX)
- Added TextAttr class (Alex Fenton)
- Fixed some bugs in caret sample (Roy Sutton)
- Added Listbook support and a sample (Sean Long)
  (Note: On Linux, the sample just shows a blank window)
- Added missing LayoutConstraints#centre_x and centre_y (Roy Sutton)
- Added SplitterWindow (thanks to Roy Sutton)
- Added TreeCtrl (compiles and can be new'd, but might segfault)
- Minor fix to calendar sample (Roy Sutton)
- Fix how Calendar enums were being defined, so the calendar sample
  "highlight special dates" menu item now works (Roy Sutton)
- Fix typo in listbook sample data (Roy Sutton)
- Fixed TreeCtrl to compile under MS Windows (Roy Sutton)
- Enabled Window#get_validator
- Adjusted TextCtrl.i and Control.i to %import their parent 
  classes so all the inherited virtual methods are wrapped by 
  the Director. This needs to be done for *all* classes.
- Added Validator class [no working sample yet] (Roy Sutton)
- Greatly enhanced Grid support (Sean Long)
  

====0.0.24 tag included all of this:===
- Restored SWIG 1.3.24 compatibility (not yet tested extensively)
- Icon patch from Sean Long for MS Win compatibility
- rakemswin.rb patch from Sean Long to properly pass __MSWIN__
  flag into swig
- samples/dialogs/dialogs.rb improvement from Roy Sutton
- Added WXTYPE typedef so methods like Event.get_event_type 
  would return simple numbers instead of weird objects,
  thanks to Roy Sutton
- Force creation of src/ file if it doesn't exist (Roy Sutton)


  

====0.0.23 tag included all of this:===
- No longer support wx 2.5.3. Now require wx 2.6+
- extconf.rb is now deprecated. Use rake instead.
- Binary library is now named wxruby2, and a small Ruby 
  wrapper named wx.rb is what is actually loaded by apps.
- MAJOR overhaul of swig build process, and now
  require SWIG 1.3.25 or newer.
  Honestly, I'm surprised it worked at all before!
- Automatically detects whether you have a suitable SWIG or not
- Integrated more patches from Sean Long:
   - XRC samples
   - Added classes: MenuItem, ToolTip
   - Added methods in several existing classes
- Created temporary fake Notebook and ToggleButton classes 
  in wx.rb, so the controls sample can run on Linux
- Eliminated several compiler warnings, some by removing 
  support for deprecated methods
- Removed deprecated NotebookSizer class
- Fixed wxEntry prototype that was causing errors under gentoo
- Integrated Choice.i unicode patch from Jani Monoses
- Updated TODO item to resemble reality
- Added xrcid module method thanks to Sean Long
- Added << operator for TextCtrl thanks to Sean Long
- Updated all copyright headers to be consistent with LICENSE
- Fixed unicode handling in Functions.i and typemap.i, and 
  remove the needless typemap from Choice.i
- Several .i file patches from Tobias Gruetzmacher:
  wxruby-crlf.patch, typemap-fix.patch, togglebutton-fix.patch
  spinevt-fix.patch, spinctrl-fix.patch, notebook-fix.patch,
  remove-kluges.patch, choice-fix.patch, rake-shell.patch,
  fix-controls-sample.patch & icons.tar.gz
- Patches for mdi sample and Dialog class from Sean Long
- Window::find_by_xxx now return a ruby object of a type 
  that matches the underlying wx type (based on a patch by Sean Long)
- No longer %ignore wxChoice() default constructor
- Now pass wx cpp flags to swig so we can do things 
  like #ifdef __WXGTK__ in the class/include/wxXxx.h files
- (Hopefully) fixed Icon to be able to compile on all platforms
- Removed deprecated wxMenuItem constructor for Mac compatibility
  (based on a patch by Sean Long)



REQUIREMENTS:

- Ruby 1.8 (Ruby 1.6 is not officially supported, but might still work)
- rake (http://rake.rubyforge.org/)
- SWIG 1.3.24 or later
- wxWidgets 2.6+ SDK


OBTAINING THE SOURCE:

No binary builds are available. Source code can be 
retrieved from CVS at:
  http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=35
  

BUILDING:

There is no ./configure step, nor do you need to 
run ruby extconf.rb. 

From the top-level directory (typically wxruby-swig/), 
start the rake build with the command:
  rake
  
You may need to edit the appropriate platform-dependent 
rake file if your system is not yet supported, or if it
is unusual. These files are found in the rake subdirectory:

  Mac OSX:              rakemacosx.rb
  MS Windows VC++:      rakemswin.rb
  MS Windows BC++:      rakebccwin.rb
  MS Windows MingGW:    rakemingw.rb
  MS Windows Cygwin:    rakecygwin.rb
  NetBSD:               rakenetbsd.rb

When editing a platform-dependent rakefile, you might 
only need to set one or more of the following variables:
    $extra_cppflags
    $extra_ldflags
    $extra_objs
    $extra_libs

INSTALLING THE LIBRARY:

You can install the library using:
  rake install
  
Note that on some systems you may need to be "root" to do this.
To manually install, copy all the files in the lib/ subdirectory 
to somewhere on your ruby library path, such as a ruby extensions 
directory.


TESTING:

To use wxruby-swig in your app, use:
  require 'wx'

Several samples are available:
	samples/calendar/calendar.rb
	samples/test.rb
	samples/caret/caret.rb
	samples/controls/controls.rb
	samples/controls/get_item_sample.rb
	samples/dialogs/dialogs.rb
	samples/etc/choice.rb
	samples/images/images.rb
	samples/mdi/mdi.rb
	samples/minimal/minimal.rb
	samples/minimal/nothing.rb
	samples/minimal/text.rb
  


NOTES:
- Since initialize is reserved in ruby, use SplitterWindow#init instead.
- Uninitialized client data will have the value (false), 
  not (nil). This is a change from wxRuby 0.3 and earlier.
- wxDateTime has not been wrapped. Use Ruby's DateTime 
  whenever a wxDateTime is specified.
- wxString has not been wrapped. Use a normal Ruby String
  whenever a wxString is specified.
- log_message and log_status take a single string parameter, 
  rather than a format string followed by additional values 
  to be inserted.
- The following classes are supported:
App.i                FontData.i                    Notebook.i
