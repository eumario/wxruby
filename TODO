High priority TODO items:
-------------------------

- Fix copyrights in all the .i files to be consistent

- Implement wxNotebook on Linux

- Insert placeholder .i files for any wx classes that we specifically 
do not want to support, such as wxDateTime and the socket classes.

- Remove all typemaps from individual class .i files

- Allow passing local-encoding strings into unicode versions of wx
(perhaps with a global runtime setting to say that all ruby strings
should use local-encoding, UTF-8, or some other encoding)

- Make sure samples/caret/caret.rb About box works (with copyright character)
This should be done after the unicode fixes.

- Start building gems

- (Probably on 2005-08-10) Delete src/extconf.rb (after "rake install" works)

- (Probably on 2005-08-10) Delete src/version_script




==================================================
NOTE: The rest of this file is WAY out of date. 
Don't pay much attention to it.



- Remove memory debug output

- Add mark/free handling to typemap methods

- Add support for overloaded constructors (and fix calendar sample)
  - and fix cases in minimal.rb
  
- NOTE: Any method that returns an object (rather 
  than an object reference or pointer) is currently 
  being removed by swig. ARGH!

- Add support for evt_xxx(:method) as an alternative

- Remove debugging output for director constructors/destructors

- Compiling DC causes a ton of warnings, due to SWIG not 
  initializing all the variables
  
- Create rake target "version" that will update the version 
  in the README, and the runtime version string
  
- rake for 1.6.7 (should we bundle rake?)
  
- Test and fix rakefile for MSWin

- Add support for statically linking wxWidgets library

- Use more cool features from rbconfig.rb

- Add aliases like label and label= for get_label and set_label

- Problem classes:
	rubyClass = rb_define_class_under(GetWxModule(),"ArtProvider", rb_cObject);

- Probably not needed?
    wxString, wxDateTime, wxDateSpan, wxTimeSpan
