h1(#wxbusycursor). Wx::BusyCursor

This class makes it easy to tell your user that the program is
temporarily busy.  Just call the class method "busy":BusyCursor_busy,
passing it a block; while the block is executed, the system's hourglass
cursor will be displayed.

For example:

 Wx::BusyCursor.busy do 
   # do some lengthy operation
   # ...
 end

h3(#BusyCursor_busy). BusyCursor.busy

  *BusyCursor.busy*() { ... }

Changes the cursor into the system's 'busy' indicator (typically an
hourglass), calls the passed block, then returns the cursor to normal
once the block is completed.
