============================================================================
THE FOLLOWING IS NOT PART OF THE LICENSE, NOR IS IT LEGAL ADVICE!

wxRuby and wxWidgets
--------------------
Normally, wxRuby is distributed with a binary copy of wxWidgets. If you 
distribute the wxRuby gem, you are bound to the requirements of the 
copy of wxWidgets within. Fortunately, those requirements do not impose 
any serious restrictions.


wxWidgets License Summary (from the wxWidgets README)
-----------------------------------------------------
In summary, the licence is LGPL plus a clause allowing unrestricted 
distribution of application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you don't have to 
distribute any source if you wish to write commercial applications using 
wxWidgets.


Required Credits and Attribution
--------------------------------

Generally, neither wxWidgets nor wxRuby require attribution, beyond 
retaining existing copyright notices. However, if you build your own 
custom wxWidgets library, there may be portions that require specific 
attributions or credits, such as TIFF or JPEG support. See the wxWidgets 
README and license files for details.
