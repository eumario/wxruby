README for wxruby-swig
Version 0.0.16

This is a very early release of a swig-based version 
of wxRuby. It can run the "minimal" sample. It only 
supports 36 classes, compared to 139 in wxRuby 0.3, 
and over 300 in all of wxWidgets.

It is released under a permissive MIT-style license.

There are no binaries. You must build it from source.


WHATS NEW:
- Switched version control from darcs to CVS. Now hosted 
  at rubyforge.org, as a second cvs module within the 
  wxruby project. [Nick]
- Internally use wx hash instead of ruby hash, so objects
  can be freed by ruby [Nick]
- MS Windows compilation fixes [Nick]
- Avoid dynamic_cast, hopefully to avoid need for RTTI [Kevin]
- Major README updates [Kevin]


  

REQUIREMENTS:

- wxWindows 2.4 SDK
- rake (http://rake.rubyforge.org/)
- Debian GNU/Linux is the only known working platform
  Other platforms might be supported already, but they 
  have not been tested yet (see below)
- OPTIONAL: SWIG pre-1.3.22 from CVS
  Swig'd .cpp and .h files are included in this package, 
  so you don't actually need SWIG.
  Note: If you use SWIG, it *MUST* be later than 1.3.21,
  which includes the patch to create directors for 
  classes with virtual destructors but no virtual methods.


INSTALLATION:

No binary builds are available. Source code can be 
retrieved from CVS at:
  http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=35
  
If you intend to perform the SWIG step yourself, you 
will need SWIG 1.3.22 or later (which has not yet been 
released, but is available from the SWIG cvs tree), and 
NQXML (a pure Ruby XML parser). 

You will also need to set the following environment 
variable on your system: WXRUBY_SWIG=YES

Otherwise, the rakefile will trust that the src/ 
directory already contains all the swigged output.
  


BUILDING:

There is no ./configure step, nor do you need to 
run ruby extconf.rb. 

From the top-level directory (typically wxruby-swig/), 
start the rake build with the command:
  rake
  
You may need to edit the appropriate platform-dependent 
rake file if your system is not yet supported, or if it
is unusual. These files are found in the rake subdirectory:

  Mac OSX:              rakemacosx.rb
  MS Windows VC++:      rakemswin.rb
  MS Windows BC++:      rakebccwin.rb
  MS Windows MingGW:    rakemingw.rb
  MS Windows Cygwin:    rakecygwin.rb
  NetBSD:               rakenetbsd.rb

When editing a platform-dependent rakefile, you might 
only need to set one or more of the following variables:
    $extra_cppflags
    $extra_ldflags
    $extra_objs
    $extra_libs


TESTING:

NOTE: For now, you must require 'wx' instead of 'wxruby'
in any apps. This allows you to have the real wxRuby 
and this wxRuby-SWIG on your system at the same time.

Very few classes are supported, but each class supports 
almost all of the available methods. You can try the samples:
  ruby samples/test.rb
  ruby samples/minimal/nothing.rb
  ruby samples/minimal/minimal.rb
  


NOTES:
- Uninitialized client data will have the value (false), 
  not (nil). This is a change from wxRuby 0.3 and earlier.
- wxDateTime has not been wrapped. Use Ruby's DateTime 
  whenever a wxDateTime is specified.
- wxString has not been wrapped. Use a normal Ruby String
  whenever a wxString is specified.
- log_message and log_status take a single string parameter, 
  rather than a format string followed by additional values 
  to be inserted.
- The following classes are supported:
    App.i               CheckBox.i          Frame.i       Size.i
    Bitmap.i            Choice.i            GDIObject.i   Sizer.i
    BitmapButton.i      CloseEvent.i        Icon.i        StaticText.i
    BoxSizer.i          CommandEvent.i      Menu.i        UpdateUIEvent.i
    Brush.i             Control.i           MenuBar.i     Window.i
    Button.i            ControlWithItems.i  Object.i      WindowDC.i
    CalendarCtrl.i      DC.i                PaintDC.i     
    CalendarDateAttr.i  Dialog.i            PaintEvent.i
    CalendarEvent.i     Event.i             Panel.i
    Caret.i             EvtHandler.i        Point.i
