  match wx (Sean Long)

- Added globals: display_depth, display_size, get_display_size and 
  display_size_mm, get_display_size_mm (Sean Long)
- Added ScrollWinEvent class and sample (Alex Fenton and Joe Seeley)
- Exposed member variables in KeyEvent (Sean Long)
- Added Sash classes and sample, but they don't yet work perfectly, at 
    least under Linux (Alex Fenton)
- Added GenericDirCtrl class (Alex Fenton)
- Added Wizard support (Wizard, WizardEvent, WizardPage, WizardPageSimple)
    and a sample (Alex Fenton)

    (Daniel F. Savarese)

====0.0.32 tag included all of this:===
- Fix BoxSizer and StaticBoxSizer (Daniel F. Savarese and Roy Sutton)
    Added "virtual" where needed, and added some missing methods
- Get bigdemo ToolBar sample working (Roy Sutton)
- Get text/textctrl.rb sample working (Roy Sutton)
- Remove unneeded typemaps (Alex Fenton)
- Ignore redundant variations of methods like get_size and get_position,
    some constructors and cases of create, draw_lines, draw_polygon,
	  ListBox#set
- Ignore (temporarily?) methods that now give errors:
    get_text_extent, get_multi_line_text_extent
- Fix SWIG warnings by adding missing virtual destructor declarations
- Now include SWIG's ruby typemaps.i file (Alex Fenton)
- Reverted the wxWidget Assert catching that was just put in
  (It was causing hanging intead of terminating the app)
- Added DISOWN markers for Frame and MDIParentFrame MenuBars (Roy Sutton)
- Add ListEvent and ListItem; improve ListCtrl and ListItemAttr (Roy Sutton)
- Fix icon handling in bigdemo ListCtrl_virtual code (Roy Sutton)
- Catch wxWidgets Asserts and raise them as Ruby fatal exceptions, to avoid 
  a cascade of worthless "addr2line" console output on Linux
- Fix bigdemo to allow right-side splitter to be resized. (It was being 
  created with the splitter bar so high that it was under the tabs of the 
	notebook, and therefore couldn't be resized)
- Fix wxTextCtrl.h compile errors by removing overflow() (Roy Sutton)
- Fix swig object tracking, hopefully fixing many crashes (Roy Sutton)
- Patch to avoid almost immediate crashing in all samples on Linux after 
  above patch was applied. Running minimal.rb, and opening and closing the 
	Help/About box was the easiest way to see the problem. For some reason, 
	an internal value was Qnil but the SWIG code was not checking for that.
- Small fix to typemaps for wxString return values (Roy Sutton)
- Require swig 1.3.29 or later (thanks to Roy Sutton)
- Fix detection of Intel Macs (Sean Long)

====0.0.31 tag included all of this:===
*** NOTE: At this point, wxruby2 compiles and links on Ubuntu GNU/Linux, and

  - controls.rb sample: Temporarily removed ArtProvider stuff that is crashing
  - Button: Made GetLabel and SetLabel methods virtual

      made GetLabel and SetLabel virtual

  - TextCtrl: Refreshed entire definition, making several more methods virtual
  - TreeCtrl: Implemented internal hack to work around the fact that this 
      class has different superclasses on different platforms

      the ArtProvider stuff doesn't really work yet (at least it compiles!)

- BIG changes to target SWIG 1.3.29:
  - Removed swig option: -noextern
  - ArtProvider: Removed non-static create_bitmap method (not sure why exactly)
  - Partly disabled SWIG Director Exceptions because they caused link errors
      (but they are only partly disabled, and actually sort of work)
  - SWIG post-processor fixmodule now deletes the GCItem destructor, and
      the UnknownExceptionHandler::handler method (both were causing errors 
	  during compiling)
  - Added a directorout typemap for wxString
