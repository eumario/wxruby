- Added full inheritance to classes starting with A through S
- Fixed parent of ProgressDialog to be Dialog


====0.0.25 tag included all of this:===
- Added src/.cvsignore
- Added Button constants (BU_XXX)
- Added TextAttr class (Alex Fenton)
- Fixed some bugs in caret sample (Roy Sutton)
- Added Listbook support and a sample (Sean Long)
  (Note: On Linux, the sample just shows a blank window)
- Added missing LayoutConstraints#centre_x and centre_y (Roy Sutton)
- Added SplitterWindow (thanks to Roy Sutton)
- Added TreeCtrl (compiles and can be new'd, but might segfault)
- Minor fix to calendar sample (Roy Sutton)
- Fix how Calendar enums were being defined, so the calendar sample
  "highlight special dates" menu item now works (Roy Sutton)
- Fix typo in listbook sample data (Roy Sutton)
- Fixed TreeCtrl to compile under MS Windows (Roy Sutton)
- Enabled Window#get_validator
- Adjusted TextCtrl.i and Control.i to %import their parent 
  classes so all the inherited virtual methods are wrapped by 
  the Director. This needs to be done for *all* classes.
- Added Validator class [no working sample yet] (Roy Sutton)
- Greatly enhanced Grid support (Sean Long)
  

====0.0.24 tag included all of this:===
- Restored SWIG 1.3.24 compatibility (not yet tested extensively)
- Icon patch from Sean Long for MS Win compatibility
- rakemswin.rb patch from Sean Long to properly pass __MSWIN__
  flag into swig
- samples/dialogs/dialogs.rb improvement from Roy Sutton
- Added WXTYPE typedef so methods like Event.get_event_type 
  would return simple numbers instead of weird objects,
  thanks to Roy Sutton
- Force creation of src/ file if it doesn't exist (Roy Sutton)


  

====0.0.23 tag included all of this:===
- No longer support wx 2.5.3. Now require wx 2.6+
- extconf.rb is now deprecated. Use rake instead.
- Binary library is now named wxruby2, and a small Ruby 
  wrapper named wx.rb is what is actually loaded by apps.
- MAJOR overhaul of swig build process, and now
  require SWIG 1.3.25 or newer.
  Honestly, I'm surprised it worked at all before!
- Automatically detects whether you have a suitable SWIG or not
- Integrated more patches from Sean Long:
   - XRC samples
   - Added classes: MenuItem, ToolTip
   - Added methods in several existing classes
- Created temporary fake Notebook and ToggleButton classes 
  in wx.rb, so the controls sample can run on Linux
- Eliminated several compiler warnings, some by removing 
  support for deprecated methods
- Removed deprecated NotebookSizer class
- Fixed wxEntry prototype that was causing errors under gentoo
- Integrated Choice.i unicode patch from Jani Monoses
- Updated TODO item to resemble reality
- Added xrcid module method thanks to Sean Long
- Added << operator for TextCtrl thanks to Sean Long
- Updated all copyright headers to be consistent with LICENSE
- Fixed unicode handling in Functions.i and typemap.i, and 
  remove the needless typemap from Choice.i
- Several .i file patches from Tobias Gruetzmacher:
  wxruby-crlf.patch, typemap-fix.patch, togglebutton-fix.patch
  spinevt-fix.patch, spinctrl-fix.patch, notebook-fix.patch,
  remove-kluges.patch, choice-fix.patch, rake-shell.patch,
  fix-controls-sample.patch & icons.tar.gz
- Patches for mdi sample and Dialog class from Sean Long
- Window::find_by_xxx now return a ruby object of a type 
  that matches the underlying wx type (based on a patch by Sean Long)
- No longer %ignore wxChoice() default constructor
- Now pass wx cpp flags to swig so we can do things 
  like #ifdef __WXGTK__ in the class/include/wxXxx.h files
- (Hopefully) fixed Icon to be able to compile on all platforms
- Removed deprecated wxMenuItem constructor for Mac compatibility
  (based on a patch by Sean Long)
