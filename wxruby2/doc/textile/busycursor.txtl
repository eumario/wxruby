h1(#wxbusycursor). Wx::BusyCursor

This class makes it easy to tell your user that the program is temporarily busy.
Just create a BusyCursor object on the stack, and within the current scope,
the hourglass will be shown.

For example:


   BusyCursor wait;
 
   for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
     DoACalculation();
 

It works by calling "BeginBusyCursor":beginbusycursor.html in the constructor,
and "EndBusyCursor":endbusycursor.html in the destructor.
