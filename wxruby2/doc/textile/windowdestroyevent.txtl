h1(#wxwindowdestroyevent). Wx::WindowDestroyEvent

This event is sent when a window is destroyed. It is a subclass of
"CommandEvent":commandevent.html and so it is propagated up the window
hierarchy. This means that frames, panels and other container windows
can listen for the destruction of controls that they contain.

h2. Derived from

"CommandEvent":event.html

"Event":event.html

"Object":object.html

h2. Event hooks

To process a window destruction event, use the @evt_window_destroy@ event hook
to handle the event using a block. The block receives a
WindowDestroyEvent argument.

Note that if you specify your own evt_window_destroy handler, you *MUST*
call "event.skip":event.html#Event_skip on the event. This ensures it is
passed on to wxRuby's internal evt_window_destroy handlers, where it
used in memory management.
