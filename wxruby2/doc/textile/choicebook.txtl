h1(#wxchoicebook). Wx::Choicebook

Choicebook is a class similar to "Notebook":notebook.html but which
uses a "Choice":choice.html to show the labels instead of the
tabs.

There is no documentation for this class yet but its usage is
identical to Notebook (except for the features clearly related to tabs
only), so please refer to that class documentation for now. You can also
use the "notebook sample":samplenotebook.html to see Choicebook in action.
