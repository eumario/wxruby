h1(#wxcontexthelp). Wx::ContextHelp

This class changes the cursor to a query and puts the application into a 'context-sensitive help mode'.
When the user left-clicks on a window within the specified window, a EVT_HELP event is
sent to that control, and the application may respond to it by popping up some help.

For example:


   ContextHelp contextHelp(myWindow);
 

There are a couple of ways to invoke this behaviour implicitly:


* Use the DIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP style for a dialog (Windows only). This will put a question mark
in the titlebar, and Windows will put the application into context-sensitive help mode automatically,
with further programming.
* Create a "ContextHelpButton":contexthelpbutton.html, whose predefined behaviour is to create a context help object.
Normally you will write your application so that this button is only added to a dialog for non-Windows platforms
(use DIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP on Windows).


Note that on Mac OS X, the cursor does not change when in context-sensitive
help mode.

h3(#ContextHelp_new). ContextHelp.new

  *ContextHelp.new*(%(arg-type)Window% window = nil,  %(arg-type)Boolean% doNow = true)

Constructs a context help object, calling "begin_context_help":#ContextHelp_begincontexthelp if _doNow_ is true (the default).

If _window_ is NULL, the top window is used.

  *destructor*()

Destroys the context help object.

h3(#ContextHelp_begincontexthelp). ContextHelp#begin_context_help

 Boolean *begin_context_help*(%(arg-type)Window% window = nil)

Puts the application into context-sensitive help mode. _window_ is the window
which will be used to catch events; if NULL, the top window will be used.

Returns true if the application was successfully put into context-sensitive help mode.
This function only returns when the event loop has finished.

h3(#ContextHelp_endcontexthelp). ContextHelp#end_context_help

 Boolean *end_context_help*()

Ends context-sensitive help mode. Not normally called by the application.
