h1(#wxmenuevent). Wx::MenuEvent

This class is used to represent a variety of menu-related events such as
highlighting, opening and closing items. Note that the commonest event
to be handled from menus - that of actually choosing a menu item - is
not a MenuEvent but a "CommandEvent":commandevent.html, captured by
using @evt_menu@.

The default handler for @evt_menu_highlight@ displays help text in the
first field of the status bar.

h2. Event table macros

To process a menu event, use these event handler macros to direct input to member
functions that take a MenuEvent argument. They can only be processed by
a menubar's frame.



|*evt_menu_open()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|A menu is about to be opened. On Windows,this is only sent once for each navigation of the menubar (up until all menus have closed).|
