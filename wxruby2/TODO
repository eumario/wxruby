High priority TODO items:
-------------------------

- Fix crashes when garbage collection happens
  * First, make sure all these classes have directors:
	BusyCursor.h - should be polymorphic but compiler complains
	CalendarDateAttr.h - not polymorphic
	ChoicebookEvent.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	ClassInfo.h
	GridCellAttr.h
	GridCellFloatRenderer.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	GridCellNumberEditor.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	GridCellNumberRenderer.h
	Icon.h
	ListbookEvent.h
	ListItemAttr.h
	MemoryDC.h
	Point.h
	Size.h
	TextAttr.h
	WindowDisabler.h

- Make sure all cases of (int,array) that are typemapped to a single
  parameter have an equivalent wxArrayString (or whatever), to work 
  around a swig bug that results in uninitialized parameters.
  
- Eliminate massive duplication between swig/Events.i and 
  swig/classes/EvtHandler.i (probably by deleting what's in Event.i).
  Probably also should rename Events.i to avoid confusion with 
  swig/classes/Event.i.

- Fix all "can't return" warnings for non-pointer objects

- Switch from CVS to darcs?

- Get bigdemo working

- Add detection of "initialize" methods to renamer.rb, and
  rename them to "init"

- Add classes that were supported in wxruby 0.6

- Try to get rid of compile warnings

- Insert placeholder .i files for any wx classes that we specifically 
do not want to support, such as wxDateTime and the socket classes.

- Remove all typemaps from individual class .i files

- Allow passing local-encoding strings into unicode versions of wx
(perhaps with a global runtime setting to say that all ruby strings
should use local-encoding, UTF-8, or some other encoding)

- Make sure samples/caret/caret.rb About box works (with copyright character)
This should be done after the unicode fixes.

- Start building gems

- Should we automatically call init_all_image_handlers?




==================================================
NOTE: The rest of this file is WAY out of date. 
Don't pay much attention to it.



- Remove memory debug output

- Add mark/free handling to typemap methods

- Add support for overloaded constructors (and fix calendar sample)
  - and fix cases in minimal.rb
  
- NOTE: Any method that returns an object (rather 
  than an object reference or pointer) is currently 
  being removed by swig. ARGH!

- Add support for evt_xxx(:method) as an alternative

- Remove debugging output for director constructors/destructors

- Compiling DC causes a ton of warnings, due to SWIG not 
  initializing all the variables
  
- Create rake target "version" that will update the version 
  in the README, and the runtime version string
  
- Add support for statically linking wxWidgets library

- Add aliases like label and label= for get_label and set_label

- Problem classes:
	rubyClass = rb_define_class_under(GetWxModule(),"ArtProvider", rb_cObject);
