High priority TODO items:

Visible Bugs
------------

- Fix crashes when garbage collection happens
  * First, make sure all these classes have directors:
	BusyCursor.h - should be polymorphic but compiler complains
	CalendarDateAttr.h - not polymorphic
	ChoicebookEvent.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	ClassInfo.h
	GridCellAttr.h
	GridCellFloatRenderer.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	GridCellNumberEditor.h - should be polymorphic but swig doesn't create director
	GridCellNumberRenderer.h
	Icon.h
	ListbookEvent.h
	ListItemAttr.h
	MemoryDC.h
	Point.h
	Size.h
	TextAttr.h
	WindowDisabler.h

- SashWindows sashes not displaying until pulled (Linux)

- Splitters in bigdemo sometimes disappear when loading source (OS X)

- Truncation/missing widgets in bigdemo (OS X)

- Caret sample not working with unicode builds, need to fix
  KeyEvent#get_unicode _key (OS X)

Underlying SWIG & Build system problems
---------------------------------------

- Make sure all cases of (int,array) that are typemapped to a single
  parameter have an equivalent wxArrayString (or whatever), to work 
  around a swig bug that results in uninitialized parameters.
  
- Get all the methods that return objects (instead of object pointers)
  to work
  
- Make sure we return an existing Ruby object whenever a wrapped wx object
  is returned
  
- Rename Events.i to avoid confusion with swig/classes/Event.i.

- Fix all "can't return" warnings for non-pointer objects

- Add detection of "initialize" methods to renamer.rb, and
  rename them to "init"

- Add classes that were supported in wxruby 0.6.0

- Try to get rid of compile warnings

- Insert placeholder .i files for any wx classes that we specifically 
  do not want to support, such as wxDateTime and the socket classes.

- Move all typemaps into a swig/typemaps/ directory, and include the 
  appropriate ones on a class-by-class basis.

- Allow passing local-encoding strings into unicode versions of wx
(perhaps with a global runtime setting to say that all ruby strings
should use local-encoding, UTF-8, or some other encoding)

- Clean up fixevents.rb code

- Eliminate the list in parents.rb and just build the list automatically 
  from the wx header files

==================================================
NOTE: The rest of this file is WAY out of date. 
Don't pay much attention to it.

- Add mark/free handling to typemap methods
  
- NOTE: Any method that returns an object (rather 
  than an object reference or pointer) is currently 
  being removed by swig. ARGH!

- Add support for evt_xxx(:method) as an alternative

- Remove debugging output for director constructors/destructors

- Add aliases like label and label= for get_label and set_label. Patch 
  submitted, decide later whether to apply.

- Problem classes:
	rubyClass = rb_define_class_under(GetWxModule(),"ArtProvider", rb_cObject);
