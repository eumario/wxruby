  It's in samples/bigdemo, and you start it by running Main.rbw.
  It doesn't work yet, but will be great when it does!
- Get new inheritance chain code to compile under MS Win (Roy Sutton)
- Fix DC.h and WindowDC.i to properly handle pure virtual methods, 
  allowing the caret sample to work again
- Fixed ControlWithItems, Choice, ComboBox and ListBox to properly 
  handle pure virtual methods, allowing the controls sample to work again
- Properly mark more Dialog methods as being virtual (Roy Sutton)
- Fixed all the Event classes to properly handle pure virtual methods
- Fixed all the GridXxxRenderer classes to handle pure virtual methods
- Fixed all the Sizer classes to handle pure virtual methods
- Fixed TipProvider to be an abstract base class

  "highlight special dates" menu item now works (Roy Sutton)
- Fix typo in listbook sample data (Roy Sutton)
- Fixed TreeCtrl to compile under MS Windows (Roy Sutton)

- Adjusted TextCtrl.i and Control.i to %import their parent 
  classes so all the inherited virtual methods are wrapped by 
  the Director. This needs to be done for *all* classes.
- Added Validator class [no working sample yet] (Roy Sutton)
  

====0.0.24 tag included all of this:===
- Restored SWIG 1.3.24 compatibility (not yet tested extensively)
- Icon patch from Sean Long for MS Win compatibility
- rakemswin.rb patch from Sean Long to properly pass __MSWIN__
  flag into swig

  would return simple numbers instead of weird objects,
  thanks to Roy Sutton

- No longer support wx 2.5.3. Now require wx 2.6+

  require SWIG 1.3.25 or newer.
  Honestly, I'm surprised it worked at all before!
