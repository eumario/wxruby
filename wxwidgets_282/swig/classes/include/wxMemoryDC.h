the DC (and therefore the bitmap) and also to use   to copy
the bitmap to a window. For this purpose, you may find  
easier to use instead.

If the argument is wxNullBitmap (or some other uninitialised wxBitmap) the current bitmap is selected out of the device
context, and the original bitmap restored, allowing the current bitmap to
be destroyed safely.
