h1(#wxeraseevent). Wx::EraseEvent

An erase event is sent when a window's background needs to be repainted.

On some platforms, such as GTK+, this event is simulated (simply generated just before the
paint event) and may cause flicker. It is therefore recommended that
you set the text background colour explicitly in order to prevent flicker.
The default background colour under GTK+ is grey.

To intercept this event, use the EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND macro in an event table definition.

You must call EraseEvent::GetDC and use the returned device context if it is non-NULL.
If it is NULL, create your own temporary ClientDC object.

h2. Event table macros

To process an erase event, use this event handler macro to direct input to a member
function that takes a EraseEvent argument.



|*evt_erase_background()&nbsp;{&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;...&nbsp;}*|Process a EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND event.|

h2. Remarks

Use the device context returned by "GetDC":eraseeventgetdc.html to draw on,
don't create a PaintDC in the event handler.
