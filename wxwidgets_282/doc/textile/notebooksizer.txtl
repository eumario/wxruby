h1(#wxnotebooksizer). Wx::NotebookSizer

*This class is deprecated and should not be used in new code! It is no
longer needed, **"Notebook":notebook.html** control can be inserted
into any sizer class and its minimal size will be determined correctly.
See **"Sizer overview":sizeroverview.html** for more information.*

NotebookSizer is a specialized sizer to make sizers work in connection
with using notebooks. This sizer is different from any other sizer as 
you must not add any children to it - instead, it queries the notebook class itself.
The only thing this sizer does is to determine the size of the biggest
page of the notebook and report an adjusted minimal size to a more toplevel
sizer.
