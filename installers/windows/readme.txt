Readme for wxRuby Windows Installer
===================================

This is quick'n'dirty documentation for the wxRuby windows
installer. Later on I'll fill this out a little better.

While this is the first wxRuby installer, cvs repository
structure was designed to accomodate installers for other
platforms:

wxruby/installers
wxruby/samples
wxruby/src

Under wxruby/installers there will be one directory for
each platform, but currently there is only windows:

wxruby/installers/windows
wxruby/installers/windows/wxruby-dbg
wxruby/installers/windows/wxruby-rel

The base directory "wxruby/installers/windows" contains
this readme file and all of the scripts needed to build
a two wxrRuby windows installers -- a debug and a release
version.

The resulting installer is designed to be installed with
one-click windows installer for Ruby. The wxRuby installer
looks for the Ruby installer's entries in the windows
registry to detemine where to copy the wxruby.so file.

The "wxruby-dbg" and "wxuby-rel" subdirectories are not
in cvs, but are created as part of the process of building
an installer. At the moment, I am building these directories
by hand, but eventually I need to create a script to make
them. They each have the following structure (where "xxx"
can be "dbg" or "rel":

wxruby-xxx/help
wxruby-xxx/lib
wxruby-xxx/samples
wxruby-xxx/src

This structure is mirrored on the end-user's machine after
he runs the installer. 

wxruby-xxx -- The base directory contains the readme's,
license, and copying files from the base wxruby cvs directory.

wxruby-xxx/src -- This is just a copy of the contents of
the "wxruby/src" directory.

wxruby-xxx/samples -- This is a copy of the "wxruby/samples"
directory, except that each sample app has been renamed to
have an extension of "rbw" instead of "rb". This prevents
a command window from opening when the sample is run.

wxruby-xxx/lib -- This is where the wxruby.so file is placed.
The wxruby-dbg/lib directoryalso contains MSVCRTD.DLL, the debug
version of the C runtime library, and the MS VC++ debug symbols
for wxruby.so.

wxruby-xxx/help -- This contains the wxRuby api help files.
These files are automatically generated by running the
script:
   wxruby/installers/windows/generate_poor_mans_docs.rb
  
The files are created in a "raw_data" directory and must be 
moved to the help folder. Also, make a copy of index.html
and name that copy "wxrubydoc.html".

The installer itself is created using the NSIS 2.0 open source
windows installer:

  http://nsis.sourceforge.net/site/index.php

There are two installer scripts, one for building the debug
installer and one for building the release installer:

wxruby/installers/windows/wxruby-debug.nsi
wxruby/installers/windows/wxruby-release.nsi
