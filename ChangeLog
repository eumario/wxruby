  match wx (Sean Long)

  display_size_mm, get_display_size_mm (Sean Long)
- Added ScrollWinEvent class and sample (Alex Fenton and Joe Seeley)
- Exposed member variables in KeyEvent (Sean Long)

    (Daniel F. Savarese)

 ====0.0.32 tag included all of this:===
- Fix BoxSizer and StaticBoxSizer (Daniel F. Savarese and Roy Sutton)
    Added "virtual" where needed, and added some missing methods
- Get bigdemo ToolBar sample working (Roy Sutton)
- Get text/textctrl.rb sample working (Roy Sutton)
- Remove unneeded typemaps (Alex Fenton)
- Ignore redundant variations of methods like get_size and get_position,
    some constructors and cases of create, draw_lines, draw_polygon,
	  ListBox#set
- Ignore (temporarily?) methods that now give errors:
    get_text_extent, get_multi_line_text_extent
- Fix SWIG warnings by adding missing virtual destructor declarations
- Now include SWIG's ruby typemaps.i file (Alex Fenton)
- Reverted the wxWidget Assert catching that was just put in
  (It was causing hanging intead of terminating the app)
- Added DISOWN markers for Frame and MDIParentFrame MenuBars (Roy Sutton)
- Add ListEvent and ListItem; improve ListCtrl and ListItemAttr (Roy Sutton)

  a cascade of worthless "addr2line" console output on Linux

      the UnknownExceptionHandler::handler method (both were causing errors 
	  during compiling)
